> ‚ö†Ô∏èüõ†Ô∏è This project is a work in progress! As of now there are no releases of any kind. See the feature list below.

This is the game of chess implemented in [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) using a purely functional programming paradigm. Functionality is ensured through unit tests.

This project has no UI or I/O. This is purely just a library to be used by other code to play chess through the public facing types/function APIs. However there is a basic text renderer in the submodule [`chess/text_renderer`](https://olze.github.io/Functional-Chess/chess/text_renderer.html) to let you experiment with this library before building your own UI.

The API is minimal and easy to use. Refer to the [online documentation](https://olze.github.io/Functional-Chess/chess.html).

## Example Usage

This example showcases Gleam code, though the project may be used with any Erlang or JavaScript runtime through Gleam's toolchain.

```gleam
import chess
import chess/coordinates as coord

pub fn main() {
  // Create a new game in standard chess starting position
  let game = chess.new_game()

  echo game.status
  // => WaitingOnNextMove(White)

  // White gets all legal moves of pawn on E2
  let _ = echo chess.get_legal_moves(game, coord.e2)
  // => [StandardMoveAvailable(E3), StandardMoveAvailable(E4)]

  // White moves pawn E2 to E4
  let move = chess.StandardMove(from: coord.e2, to: coord.e4)
  let assert Ok(game) = chess.player_move(game, move)

  // Now it's black's turn
  echo game.status
  // => WaitingOnNextMove(Black)

  // Black tries to illegally move king to E5
  let illegal_move = chess.StandardMove(from: coord.e8, to: coord.e5)
  echo chess.player_move(game, illegal_move)
  // => Error(PlayerMoveIsIllegal)
}
```
